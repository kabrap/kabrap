# Intro

I am a third-year undergraduate at [Purdue CS](https://cs.purdue.edu) where I am majoring in Computer Science and Data Science with a minor in Economics. I am particularly interested in projects that analyze financial data, health and safety data, imaging, and social impact. I am a goal-oriented and high pace engineer and am specialixing in Machine Learning and Database and Information Systems while pursuing my undergraduate studies. During this past summer, I worked in the Trading Development Team at [Advisor360](https://www.advisor360.com) where I worked on upgrading product feature, fixing application and database bugs and upgrading leagacy codebase. This internship taught me the fundamentals of how to approach working on issues in the industry and how to find answers to problems, by yourself, and, by utilizing the knowledge and experience of your team members. I am actively looking for Summer 2023 internship opportunities and then full-time opportunities in December 2023.
